# Count and Say

The count-and-say sequence is the sequence of integers beginning as follows:

`1, 11, 21, 1211, 111221, ...`

> `1` is read off as `"one 1"` or `11`.
> 
> `11` is read off as `"two 1s"` or `21`.
> 
> `21` is read off as `"one 2`, then `one 1"` or `1211`.

Given an integer *n*, generate the *n*<sup>th</sup> sequence. 

**Note:** The sequence of integers will be represented as a string.
