# Unique Paths II

Follow up for "[Unique Paths](./062-UniquePaths.md)":

Now consider if some obstacles are added to the grids. How many unique paths would there be?

An obstacle and empty space is marked as `1` and `0` respectively in the grid.

For example,

> There is one obstacle in the middle of a 3x3 grid as illustrated below.
> 
> ```C
> [
>   [0,0,0],
>   [0,1,0],
>   [0,0,0]
> ]
> ```
> 
> The total number of unique paths is `2`.

**Note:* *m* and *n* will be at most 100.
